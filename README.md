# Analysis-of-Superstore-dataset--IBM
The "Analysis of Superstore Dataset" project aims to explore and analyze a comprehensive dataset from a fictional superstore. The dataset comprises information about various aspects of the store's operations, over a certain period of time. The project seeks to uncover valuable insights,  and boost overall profitability.

Purpose: The purpose of the "Analysis of Superstore dataset" is to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and operational efficiency in order to optimize store performance and make data-driven recommendations for improvement.

Scope: The scope of the analysis includes examining the Superstore dataset, which consists of sales transactions, customer demographics, product categories, and geographical regions. The analysis will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, sales analysis, customer behavior analysis, and operational efficiency analysis.
